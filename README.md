<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great web browser options available on the open web; however, I couldn't find one that was completely useless and so I created this one to make up for that. I want to create a web browser that is so incredibly horrible that it'll be the last one anyone ever wants to use: a rival to Internet Explorer.

Here's why:
* Intuitive UI is a thing of the past. You should get lost trying to perform even the simplest of tasks
* There's no way in hell this project will compete with any existing programs that offer the same service
* I needed an excuse to learn C# and a project to waste my time on

The only reason this exists is so I can learn and experiment in the UWP so while I won't condemn any serious use I certainly don't reccomend using this for anything other than playing around.
<!--You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this project!-->
